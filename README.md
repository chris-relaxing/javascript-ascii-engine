# JavaScript Ascii Engine

The JavaScript ASCII Engine is a web tool I created to be able to quickly find ASCII values when a chart is not available. All you do is type in a single keyboard character in the input box and the tool will output the ASCII equivalent values in decimal, hex and binary.

I created this tool in the year 2000, and it has been featured on the [JavaScript Source](https://javascriptsource.com/), as well as other free JavaScript source repositories. I checked a few years ago and found this tool being used on university websites around the world.
